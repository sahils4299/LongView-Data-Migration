We would also like to take this opportunity to remind you that we recommend annual inspections be made by pest control companies, building inspectors and your smoke alarms checked and serviced.
 
As we are not qualified to inspect and report on the working condition of smoke alarms, we highly recommend annual inspections from a qualified electrician. Our office can arrange this service on your behalf so please contact our office to discuss this option.

Met Paul Makris at the property on 14/11/13 and we inspected units 1, 2 , 4, 5 & 6.

Only a few had mould issues, Paul was going to sort this out and get some more ventilation into the property, I suggest luver windows above front door and he agreed.

I will also draw up a letter to all our tenants at the property on how to deal with mould.

Hi John & Avalon,

Please find attached an inspection letter, we have had some reports of mould in the building on the lower level and the owner wants to have a look at all the properties.

No need for you to be home, I will be with him.

Please let me know if you have experienced any mould issues and if so where it has occurred.

Thanks

Only a few had mould issues, Paul was going to sort this out and get some more ventilation into the property, I suggest luver windows above front door and he agreed.

I will also draw up a letter to all our tenants at the property on how to deal with mould.

Hi Zack,

Please find attached an inspection letter, we have had some reports of mould in the building on the lower level and the owner wants to have a look at all the properties.

No need for you to be home, I will be with him.

Please let me know if you have experienced any mould issues and if so where it has occurred.

Thanks


Regards,

Arlette Humphry

Is there any chance I could go back to do another inspection in the next day or so.  It was very awkward on Friday as the guests were not aware of my visit and I could not carry out a proper inspection.

Subject: 6/270 Springvale road - Inspection

Hi Rosalind

Is there any chance I could go back to do another inspection in the next day or so.  It was very awkward on Friday as the guests were not aware of my visit and I could not carry out a proper inspection.

Thanks
Steph

They seem very sensitive people 
Omg !!
I made a mistake with the timing 
I thought it was 6mths 
But I agreed to it . They can’t expect rent to stay the same . Its I unrealistic 
Anyway that’s fine . 
Didn’t you guys have professional pics already if this 
property?
From these tenants moving in?
I don’t want to have to pay again
Please can you check Tess 
Should be in your records
Samantha organised it

Overall the property is not very well looked after. 
The tenants are nice though property required a repaint all around the whole property.
Tenants have caused small dents in the walls which need to be patched up.
Maintenance in the property is required.

I noted that the kitchen oven and bathroom exhaust fans were a little unclean however, and have advised the tenants to ensure these are regularly cleaned and maintained.

Maintenance Required: Roller blind in the living room has been repaired. I did also notice that the silicon around the egdes of the ensuite shower has begun to wear in areas. Please see photo included in report. I would suggest to have this repaired to prevent any internal water ingress. If you would like for me to arrange a quote on this for you, please let me know.

Please see attached summary report and additional photos for your review. If you require any further information please don't hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards,

Nadia Totaro

We wish to advise a routine inspection was recently carried out at your above property and the tenants appear to be maintaining the property in a very good condition. The apartment was presented in a neat, tidy and clean manner throughout. 

I did just notice that one of the bathroom exhaust fans was dirty, and have advised the tenants to ensure this is cleaned away as soon as possible to maintain the fan efficiency. I will continue to monitor this at the next inspection.

Maintenance Required: No maintenance to report at this time.

We wish to advise a routine inspection was recently carried out at your above property and the tenants appear to be maintaining the property in a good condition. The apartment was presented in a generally neat and tidy manner.

I did notice however that the bathroom shower grouting was a little unclean and have advised the tenants to ensure this is regularly attended and maintained so I will continue to monitor this. I also noted that the bedroom roller blind was marked and have asked the tenants to clean this immediately.

Maintenance Required: No maintenance to report at this time.

Please see attached summary report and additional photos for your review. If you require any further information please don't hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards,

Tenant mentioned that collin( husband 87 years of age) fell onto the glass door of the oven and shattered into pieces. This was reported however no photos were sent as tenants are not tech savvy.  Glass door will need to be replaced.
